🔴 Project Name : Home-Security-System-using-ESP32CAM-and-Telegram.

<br  />

📷 About Project -  

🚩   In this project we’ll build a Home Security System using ESP32 CAM Which will notify us on Telegram App about any Intruder trying to break in our house by capturing and sending his photo to us. For that we’ve used PIR motion Sensors and Magnetic Door Sensors.

🚩   We’ve also implemented Fire, Smoke and Gas Leak Alert system in this Project.

🚩   In this project you’ll learn how to Create Telegram Bot to Monitor  Home Security System from anywhere in the world.

🚩   ESP32CAM will interact with the Telegram bot to receive and handle the messages, and send responses. In this project you’ll learn how to use Telegram to send messages to your bot to (Arm/Disarm) the Security System features from anywhere (you just need Telegram and access to the internet).
