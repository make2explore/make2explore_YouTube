🔴 Project Name : Monitor and Control Weather Station with Telegram App

<br  />

📷 About Project -   

🚩   In this project we'll built Weather Station which keeps record of meteorological parameters. It measures atmospheric conditions to provide information for weather forecasts and to study the weather and climate.  

🚩   We're adding a facility to this weather station which makes it to be accessed and controlled from anywhere from the world. We'll create Telegram Bot for our Weather Station and program it to get interact and give responses about sensor readings and relay outputs whenever we will contact it using telegram Application from our Smartphone or from PC.  

🚩   So you just need to send a message to your Telegram Bot to monitor/Control your sensors/Outputs from anywhere in the world.
